# ConstVault

**ConstVault** is a simple, yet powerful C# app that helps creative persons by storing and organizing work dir paths, url-s, or any kind of text (**Consts** for short), which they can copy back to the clipboard any time by a click or pressing a hotkey.

## Why?

I'm sure you know the feeling when you're writing CSS, and want to paste the same RGB value again and again. You press Ctrl+V and boom, some JS code gets inserted, because that was the last thing you copied to your clipboard. Now you'll have to Ctrl+F your way through the CSS, to find the desired RGB value, Ctrl+C, then return to where you wanted to insert it... 
**ConstVault** tries to speed up this process: You can save the often used attributes on a sleek UI and copy them any time by a simple mouse click / hotkey press.

## So is this another clipboard manager then?

Not exactly! With **ConstVault**, you can also save working directory paths, which you can find and jump to easily.
Another very useful feature is, that you can save these sets of **Consts**, and load them in later, allowing you to create sets for your different projects.

## What else is planned?

Support for storing images as **Consts**, cloud storage of **ConstSets** for easy access through all your computers.
